# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a large dataset of video game sales using Python, specifically with the Pandas and NumPy libraries. The analysis aims to uncover insights into video game preferences globally, identify trends in game sales, and determine which games are the most popular and profitable.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is first cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and relevancy in the analysis.
- **Sales Analysis**: This project analyzes overall sales data to identify the highest-selling games across different regions.
- **Popularity Analysis**: We explore which games are most popular in various regions and why.
- **Trend Identification**: Trends over the years are identified to understand shifts in the gaming industry.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
